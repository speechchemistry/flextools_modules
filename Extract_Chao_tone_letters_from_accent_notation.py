"""
Goes through all the lexeme forms and extracts Chao tone letters (only)
from any accent notation and puts it into a Custom Pitch field. You can use
Bulk Edit Entries in Flex to move these to the desired field.

Re-running replaces the Pitch value rather than adding to it. Entries whose
lexeme form has no tone marks are left alone, so a Pitch value entered by hand
is never cleared.
